# Lessons learned in Python Programming task (end of "Think Python" challenge)

- Problem, Structure, Keyword, Content

- CRUD  -  Create, Read, Update, Delete

- Decoupling of tasks: Learning that decoupling different functionalities makes the code more compact and easier to understand

- Class methods (dictionaries): Just how many magic methods there are for dictionaries in Python

- Version control: The importance of logging changes that have been made in a manor which, weeks down the line, the code can be returned to the code and understand exactly and where I am in the code development.

- Docstrings: Providing clarity for every part of the code to allow for easy understanding and means that if I leave the code for a while I can return and know what is happening within the code.

- Tests: Creating extensive tests prior to writing the code means that what needs to be achieved from the code is already known, therefore making the code much clearer in its functionality and easier to write.

- gameloop: 

  while s != "q":
      s = input(":>")
      print(s)

- Instatiated in a single call:  this means you can call database like this

  d = Database()
